:::tip
Steps in this guide involve waiting for the **Heimdall** and **Bor** services to fully sync.
This process takes several days to complete. Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours. For detailed instructions, see [<ins>Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor</ins>](../../develop/network-details/snapshot-instructions-heimdall-bor).

For snapshot download links, see [Polygon Chains Snapshots](https://snapshots.matic.today/).

There is limited space for accepting new validators. New validators can only join the active set when an already active validator unbonds.
:::


This guide will walk you through running a Polygon validator node from binaries.

For system requirements,
follow the [Validator Node System Requirements](validator-node-system-requirements.md) guide.

If you would like to start and run the validator node through Ansible,
see [Run a Validator Node with Ansible](run-validator-ansible.md).

## Overview

To get to a running validator node, conduct the following in this **exact sequence of steps**:

> You will run into configuration issues if these steps are performed out of sequence.
> It is important to keep in mind that a sentry node must always be set up before the validator node.

1. Prepare two machines, one for the sentry node and one for the validator node.
2. Install the Heimdall and Bor binaries on the sentry and validator machines.
3. Set up the Heimdall and Bor service files on the sentry and validator machines.
4. Set up the Heimdall and Bor services on the sentry and validator machines.
5. Configure the sentry node.
6. Start the sentry node.
7. Configure the validator node.
8. Set the owner and signer keys.
9. Start the validator node.
10. Check node health with the community.

## Installing the Binaries

Install the binaries for both on the sentry and validator machines.

### Installing Heimdall

[Heimdall](../validator/core-components/heimdall-chain.md) is the proof-of-stake verifier layer
responsible for checkpointing the representation of the Plasma blocks to the Ethereum mainnet.

The latest version, [Heimdall v.0.2.11](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v0.2.11), contains a few enhancements such as:
1. Restricting data size in state sync txs to:
    * **30Kb** when represented in **bytes**
    * **60Kb** when represented as **string**.
2. Increasing the **delay time** between the contract events of different validators to ensure that the mempool doesn't get filled very quickly in case of a burst of events which can hamper the progress of the chain.

The following example shows how the data size is restricted:

```
Data - "abcd1234"
Length in string format - 8
Hex Byte representation - [171 205 18 52]
Length in byte format - 4
```

Clone the [Heimdall repository](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
```

Navigate to the correct [release version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases):

```sh
git checkout RELEASE_TAG
```

where `RELEASE_TAG` is the tag of the release version that you install.

For instance:

```sh
git checkout v0.2.11
```

Once you are on the correct release, install Heimdall:

```sh
make install
source ~/.profile
```

Check the Heimdall installation:

```sh
heimdalld version --long
```

:::note

Before proceeding, Heimdall should be installed on both the sentry and validator machines.

:::

### Installing Bor

[Bor](../../pos/bor/) is the sidechain operator that acts as the block production layer,
which syncs with Heimdall to select block producers and verifiers for each [span](../glossary#span)
and [sprint](../glossary#sprint).

Clone the [Bor repository](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
```

Navigate to the correct [release version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/releases):

```sh
git checkout RELEASE_TAG
```

where `RELEASE_TAG` is the tag of the release version that you install.

For instance:

```sh
git checkout v0.2.16
```

Install Bor:

```sh
make bor-all
```

Create symlinks:

```sh
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bor /usr/bin/bor
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bootnode /usr/bin/bootnode
```

Check the Bor installation:

```sh
bor version
```

:::note

Before proceeding, Bor should be installed on both the sentry and validator machines.

:::

## Setting Up Node Files

:::note

Node files need to be set up on both the sentry and validator machines.

:::

### Fetching the launch repository

Clone the [launch repository](https://github.com/maticnetwork/launch):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/launch
```

### Setting up the launch directory

#### On the sentry machine

Create a `node` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p node
```

Copy the files and scripts from the `launch` directory to the `node` directory:

```sh
cp -rf launch/mainnet-v1/sentry/sentry ~/node
cp launch/mainnet-v1/service.sh ~/node
```

#### On the validator machine

Create a `node` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p node
```

Copy the files and scripts from the `launch` directory to the `node` directory:

```sh
cp -rf launch/mainnet-v1/sentry/validator ~/node
cp launch/mainnet-v1/service.sh ~/node
```

### Setting up the network directories

:::note

Run this section both on the sentry and validator machines.

:::

#### Setting up Heimdall

Change to the `node` directory:

```sh
cd ~/node/heimdall
```

Run the setup script:

```sh
bash setup.sh
```

#### Setting up Bor

Change to the `node` directory:

```sh
cd ~/node/bor
```

Run the setup script:

```sh
bash setup.sh
```

## Setting Up the Services

:::note

Run this section both on the sentry and validator machines.

:::

Navigate to the `node` directory:

```sh
cd ~/node
```

Run the setup script:

```sh
bash service.sh
```

Copy the service file to the system directory:

```sh
sudo cp *.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

## Configuring the Sentry Node

Start by logging in to the remote sentry machine.

### Configuring the Heimdall services

Open the Heimdall configuration file for editing:

```sh
vi ~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml
```

In `config.toml`, change the following parameters:

* `moniker` — any name. Example: `moniker = "my-sentry-node"`.
* `seeds` — the seed node addresses consisting of a node ID, an IP address, and a port.

  Use the following values:

  ```toml
  seeds="f4f605d60b8ffaaf15240564e58a81103510631c@159.203.9.164:26656,4fb1bc820088764a564d4f66bba1963d47d82329@44.232.55.71:26656,2eadba4be3ce47ac8db0a3538cb923b57b41c927@35.199.4.13:26656,3b23b20017a6f348d329c102ddc0088f0a10a444@35.221.13.28:26656,25f5f65a09c56e9f1d2d90618aa70cd358aa68da@35.230.116.151:26656"
  ```

* `pex` — set the value to `true` to enable the peer exchange. Example: `pex = true`.
* `private_peer_ids` — the node ID of Heimdall set up on the validator machine.

  To get the node ID of Heimdall on the validator machine:

  1. Log in to the validator machine.
  2. Run:
     ```sh
     heimdalld tendermint show-node-id
     ```

  Example: `private_peer_ids = "0ee1de0515f577700a6a4b6ad882eff1eb15f066"`.

* `prometheus` — set the value to `true` to enable the Prometheus metrics. Example: `prometheus = true`.
* `max_open_connections` — set the value to `100`. Example: `max_open_connections = 100`.

Save the changes in `config.toml`.

### Configuring the Bor Service

Open the Bor configuration file for editing:

```sh
`vi ~/node/bor/start.sh`
```

In `start.sh`, add the boot node addresses consisting of a node ID, an IP address, and a port
by adding the following line at the end of the file:

```config
--bootnodes "enode://0cb82b395094ee4a2915e9714894627de9ed8498fb881cec6db7c65e8b9a5bd7f2f25cc84e71e89d0947e51c76e85d0847de848c7782b13c0255247a6758178c@44.232.55.71:30303,enode://88116f4295f5a31538ae409e4d44ad40d22e44ee9342869e7d68bdec55b0f83c1530355ce8b41fbec0928a7d75a5745d528450d30aec92066ab6ba1ee351d710@159.203.9.164:30303,enode://3178257cd1e1ab8f95eeb7cc45e28b6047a0432b2f9412cff1db9bb31426eac30edeb81fedc30b7cd3059f0902b5350f75d1b376d2c632e1b375af0553813e6f@35.221.13.28:30303,enode://16d9a28eadbd247a09ff53b7b1f22231f6deaf10b86d4b23924023aea49bfdd51465b36d79d29be46a5497a96151a1a1ea448f8a8666266284e004306b2afb6e@35.199.4.13:30303,enode://ef271e1c28382daa6ac2d1006dd1924356cfd843dbe88a7397d53396e0741ca1a8da0a113913dee52d9071f0ad8d39e3ce87aa81ebc190776432ee7ddc9d9470@35.230.116.151:30303"
```

Save the changes in `start.sh`.

### Configuring a firewall

The sentry machine must have the following ports open to the world `0.0.0.0/0`:

* `26656`- Your Heimdall service will connect your node to other nodes Heimdall service.

* `30303`- Your Bor service will connect your node to other nodes Bor service.

* `22`- For the validator to be able to ssh from wherever they are.

## Starting the Sentry Node

You will first start the Heimdall service. Once the Heimdall service syncs, you will start the Bor service.

:::note

As mentioned earlier, the Heimdall service takes several days to sync from scratch fully.

Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours.
For detailed instructions, see [<ins>Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor</ins>](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/snapshot-instructions-for-heimdall-and-bor/9233).

For snapshot download links, see [Polygon Chains Snapshots](https://snapshots.matic.today/).

:::

### Starting the Heimdall service

Start the Heimdall service:

```sh
sudo service heimdalld start
```

Start the Heimdall rest-server:

```sh
sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
```

Check the Heimdall service logs:

```sh
journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f
```

:::note

In the logs, you may see the following errors:

* `Stopping peer for error`
* `MConnection flush failed`
* `use of closed network connection`

These logs mean that one of the nodes on the network refused a connection to your node.
Wait for your node to crawl more nodes on the network; you do not need to do anything
to address these errors.

:::

Check the Heimdall rest-server logs:

```sh
journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f
```

Check the sync status of Heimdall:

```sh
curl localhost:26657/status
```

In the output, the `catching_up` value is:

* `true` — the Heimdall service is syncing.
* `false` — the Heimdall service is fully synced.

Wait for the Heimdall service to sync fully.

### Starting the Bor service

Once the Heimdall service syncs, start the Bor service.

Start the Bor service:

```sh
sudo service bor start
```

Check the Bor service logs:

```sh
journalctl -u bor.service -f
```

## Configuring the Validator Node

:::note

To complete this section, you must have an RPC endpoint of your fully synced Ethereum mainnet
node ready.

:::

### Configuring the Heimdall service

Log in to the remote validator machine.

Open for editing `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`.

In `config.toml`, change the following:

* `moniker` — any name. Example: `moniker = "my-validator-node"`.
* `pex` — set the value to `false` to disable the peer exchange. Example: `pex = false`.
* `private_peer_ids` — comment out the value to disable it. Example: `# private_peer_ids = ""`.

  To get the node ID of Heimdall on the sentry machine:

  1. Log in to the sentry machine.
  1. Run `heimdalld tendermint show-node-id`.

Example: `persistent_peers = "sentry_machineNodeID@sentry_instance_ip:26656"`

* `prometheus` — set the value to `true` to enable the Prometheus metrics. Example: `prometheus = true`.

Save the changes in `config.toml`.

Open for editing `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`.

In `heimdall-config.toml`, change the following:

* `eth_rpc_url` — an RPC endpoint for a fully synced Ethereum mainnet node,
  i.e Infura. `eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Ethereum>`

Example: `eth_rpc_url = "https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/60f2a23810ba11c827d3da642802412a"`

Save the changes in `heimdall-config.toml`.

### Configuring the Bor service

Open for editing `vi ~/.bor/data/bor/static-nodes.json`.

In `static-nodes.json`, change the following:

* `"<replace with enode://sentry_machine_enodeID@sentry_machine_ip:30303>"` — the node ID and
  IP address of Bor set up on the sentry machine.

  To get the node ID of Bor on the sentry machine:

  1. Log in to the sentry machine.
  2. Run `bootnode -nodekey ~/.bor/data/bor/nodekey -writeaddress`.

  Example: `"enode://a8024075291c0dd3467f5af51a05d531f9e518d6cd229336156eb6545581859e8997a80bc679fdb7a3bd7473744c57eeb3411719b973b2d6c69eff9056c0578f@188.166.216.25:30303"`.

Save the changes in `static-nodes.json`.

## Setting the Owner and Signer Key

On Polygon, it is recommended that you keep the owner and signer keys different.

* Signer — the address that signs the
  [checkpoint transactions](../glossary#checkpoint-transaction). The recommendation is
  to keep at least 1 ETH on the signer address.
* Owner — the address that does the staking transactions. The recommendation is to keep the MATIC
  tokens on the owner address.

### Generating a Heimdall private key

You must generate a Heimdall private key only on the validator machine. Do not generate a Heimdall
private key on the sentry machine.

To generate the private key, run:

```sh
heimdallcli generate-validatorkey ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY
```

where

* ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY — your Ethereum wallet’s private key.

This will generate `priv_validator_key.json`. Move the generated JSON file to the Heimdall configuration
directory:

```sh
mv ./priv_validator_key.json ~/.heimdalld/config
```

### Generating a Bor keystore file

You must generate a Bor keystore file only on the validator machine. Do not generate a Bor keystore file
on the sentry machine.

To generate the private key, run:

```sh
heimdallcli generate-keystore ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY
```

where

* ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY — your Ethereum wallet’s private key.

When prompted, set up a password to the keystore file.

This will generate a `UTC-<time>-<address>` keystore file.

Move the generated keystore file to the Bor configuration directory:

```sh
mv ./UTC-<time>-<address> ~/.bor/keystore/
```

### Add password.txt

Make sure to create a `password.txt` file then add the Bor keystore file password right in the
`~/.bor/password.txt` file.

### Add your Ethereum address

Open for editing `vi /etc/matic/metadata`.

In `metadata`, add your Ethereum address. Example: `VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=0xca67a8D767e45056DC92384b488E9Af654d78DE2`.

Save the changes in `metadata`.

## Starting the Validator Node

At this point, you must have:

* The Heimdall service on the sentry machine syncs and is running.
* The Bor service on the sentry machine running.
* The Heimdall service and the Bor service on the validator machine configured.
* Your owner and signer keys configured.

### Starting the Heimdall service

You will now start the Heimdall service on the validator machine. Once the Heimdall service syncs, you
will start the Bor service on the validator machine.

:::note

The Heimdall service takes several days to sync from scratch fully.

Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours.
For detailed instructions, see [<ins>Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor</ins>](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/snapshot-instructions-for-heimdall-and-bor/9233).

For snapshot download links, see [Polygon Chains Snapshots](https://snapshots.matic.today/).

:::

Start the Heimdall service:

```sh
sudo service heimdalld start
```

Start the Heimdall rest-server:

```sh
sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
```

Start the Heimdall bridge:

```sh
sudo service heimdalld-bridge start
```

Check the Heimdall service logs:

```sh
journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f
```

Check the Heimdall rest-server logs:

```sh
journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f
```

Check the Heimdall bridge logs:

```sh
journalctl -u heimdalld-bridge.service -f
```

Check the sync status of Heimdall:

```sh
curl localhost:26657/status
```

In the output, the `catching_up` value is:

* `true` — the Heimdall service is syncing.
* `false` — the Heimdall service is synced.

Wait for the Heimdall service to fully sync.

### Starting the Bor service

Once the Heimdall service on the validator machine syncs, start the Bor service on
the validator machine.

Start the Bor service:

```sh
sudo service bor start
```

Check the Bor service logs:

```sh
journalctl -u bor.service -f
```

## Health Checks with the Community

Now that your sentry and validator nodes are in sync and running, head over to
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/0xPolygon) and ask the community to health-check your nodes.

## Next Steps: Staking

Now that you have your sentry and validator nodes are health-checked, proceed to
the [Staking](../validator/core-components/staking.md) guide to start backing the network.
