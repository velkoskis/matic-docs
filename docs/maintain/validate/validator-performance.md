The Polygon Governance team administers an off-chain validator performance metric initative that 
assists validators in evaluating their network participation. Validators will eventually need to self-regulate 
network participation on Polygon to an agreed set of on-chain parameters as they network continues to decentralize. 
The validator performance metrics follow a benchmark calculation that evaluates validator performance.
