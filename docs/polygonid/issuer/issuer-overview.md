An Issuer is any subject that issues claims. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an Issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (Issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a claim.

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members.
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens.
- A Face detection Machine Learning application that issues "proof of personhood" claims. 
- An employer that endorses its employees.

<a href="https://docs.iden3.io/protocol/claims-structure/" target="_blank">Claims</a> are a flexible data format able to express any type of information so that developers can unleash their creativity.

To operate, an Issuer must set up a self-hosted server or interact with the Polygon ID Platform. 

With [Polygon ID Platform](https://platform-test.polygonid.com/) you can: 

- Register a Polygon ID Issuer Account
- Create <a href="https://docs.iden3.io/protocol/claim-schema/" target="_blank">Schemas</a> to define the structure of the claims you want to issue (or simply use existing schemas)
- Issue Claims based on the schemas just created 
- Offer these claims to your users

Here's a demo of how it looks from the Issuer perspective:
