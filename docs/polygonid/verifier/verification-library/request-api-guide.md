The first step to interact with a wallet involves presenting an authentication request. In this tutorial, we will explain the difference between two types of authentication requests: **Basic Auth** and **Query-based Auth**.

A Basic Auth requires users to prove that they are **the owners of an identity**. No further requirements are set. 

A Query-based Auth requires users to prove that:

- They are the owners of an identity. 
- They own a claim that satisfies a certain property.

## Basic Auth

The Basic Auth Request allows verifiers to interact with a wallet and authenticate the user it by its identifier.  
Polygon ID Basic Auth can be implemented by any platform that is interested in providing a seamless web2-like login experience to its users without setting any specific requirements.

### CreateAuthorizationRequest

Generate an Auth Request to the user that includes a *reason* for authenticating. The *audience* represents the identifier of the requester, while the URL is the callback URL where the user must send the response for verification.

#### Javascript

```js
const request : protocol.AuthorizationRequestMessage = auth.createAuthorizationRequest(reason, audience, url)
```

</TabItem>

### CreateAuthorizationRequestWithMessage

The same functionality of CreateAuthorizationRequest is applicable here but it also includes a *messageToSign*. This message will be shown to the users inside their wallets and will be signed as part of the response.

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Query-based Auth 

Generate a request to proof that satisfies certain requirements. 

The Query-based Auth Request allows verifiers to interact with a wallet by setting up specific requirements for authentication. These requirements are the conditions that the user has to satisfy based on the claims held in his/her wallet.

:::note
The Query has to be attached to the Basic Auth Request output of the previous API. An example of its usage can be found [<ins>here</ins>](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/tutorial-examples/tree/main/verifier-integration/js/index.js#L50).
:::

`id` represents the request id: ideally, in production, it should be a unique value for each request. `circuit_id` represents the identifier of the circuit used by the user to generate the requested proof: it can be either `credentialAtomicQuerySig` or `credentialAtomicQueryMTP`. In this case, the user has to provide a proof that he/she owns a claim issued by the `allowedIssuer` of schema `type` **KYCCountryOfResidenceCredential** described in `url`. This claim contains details of the country of residence of the receiver. In this scenario, the user has to prove that the value contained in the attribute `countryCode` is not in `nin` 840, 120, 340, 509.
