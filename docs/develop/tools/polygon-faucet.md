[Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) is a tool that allows you to get free MATIC tokens on testnet to help you get started with Polygon network. The tokens enable you to work with Polygon features without spending real MATIC on the mainnet.

:::note
Tokens on testnet networks have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.
