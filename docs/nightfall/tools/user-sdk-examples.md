Polygon Nightfall can be the go-to for private finance on Ethereum and bring more people to Ethereum with its privacy and affordability. We devide the most suitable use cases of Nightfall in two categories. Enterprise and Web3 Native.

### Enterprise

#### Supply Chain Orchestration

### Web3 Native


#### Private DE-FI

#### Private DAO(voting, payroll, petitions)

#### Private NFT Marketplace





#### Demo Web App

The Web Application is an example of how to use functionalities that SDK provides to interact with Nightfall via MetaMask. It is a great way to play around with the deposit function to bridge ERCs from Layer 1 to Nightfall, tranfser them on Nightfall and withdraw them to Layer 1.
Get into the App on the following [link](https://github.com/maticnetwork/nightfall-sdk).
