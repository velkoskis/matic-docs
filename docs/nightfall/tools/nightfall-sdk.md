## What is Nightfall SDK

Nightfall SDK is a Software Development Kit created for interacting with Polygon Nightfall. It grants developers an easy access to the Nightfall Protocol opening numerous possibilities to use accross any applications.

## SDK overview

The SDK provides the ablity to interact with the core features of the Nightfall Protocol:

- Deposit ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens from Ethereum L1 to Polygon Nightfall L2
- Transfer ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token commitments on Polygon Nightfall L2
- Withdraw ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token commitments from Polygon Nightfall L2 to Ethereum L1
- Check token balances on Polygon Nightfall L2
- Safely export and import token transaction commitments to and from Polygon Nightfall L2

To learn more about how all these functionalities are working on a Protocol level, you can head to the [Protocol Docs](/docs/nightfall/protocol/actors).

## Play around with the SDK repo

If you want to experiment beyond the NPM package, we have provided example scripts within the SDK repository. These scripts are a great way to get started if you get stuck dealing with the NPM package. They are practical examples on how to use the SDK, using the core functionalities. Running them locally gives the opportunity of understanding Nigtfall and how it works under the hood.
Explanation and running instructions can be found on the following [link](https://github.com/maticnetwork/nightfall-sdk#example-scripts).
